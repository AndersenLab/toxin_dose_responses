This research is part of a three-lab collaboration to understand the genetic basis of natural variation in *C. elegans* toxin responses. The following analyses have been conducted jointly by Tim Crombie and Sam Widmayer.

1. An overview of [8 strain dose-response curves](toxin8strains.html).

2. [Broad-sense heritability](heritability.html) describes the amount of variation in a phenotype (in our case, toxin susceptibility) that can be ascribed to genetic differences between strains.
